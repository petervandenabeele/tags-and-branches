This repo allows me to do some tests regarding tags and branches.

The specific question is how to determine the latest tag that is
deployed at a certain customer.

There is a proposal to use branches, where the HEAD of the branch
with the customer name would be the obvious way to find that out.

But, if the code in the different branches is really the same,
then using tags seems more correct (it makes it _impossible_
to accidentially have a diverging code base in any of the
customer branches).
